        <p>
            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). 
            Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
            A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. 
            Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.<br><br>
